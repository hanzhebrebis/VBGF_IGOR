# IGOR+: Fitting Growth Curves with Random Effects

IGOR is a tool that allows you to do the following tasks:
1. Create an Otolith Weight vs. Age model (piecewise or linear) with user data,
2. Use an existing Otolith Weight vs. Age model to predict ages for fish with known otolith weights,
3. Run a growth curve model (gompertz, linear, logistic, schnute, or von bertlanffy) to fit fish lengths with ages.

## Prerequisite

This Shiny app requires users to have a C++ compiler installed.
